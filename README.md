This project implements an HDMI transmitter on a Digilent Nexys 3 board using a VmodMIB Adapter.

It currently shows a test image with a resolution of 1280x1024 at 60 Hz on the VGA port and on HDMI Port JAA. The Spartan 6 should be capable of creating a signal with a resolution of up to 1080i.

Most of the code comes from Xilinx and a bit comes from bunnie's awesome NeTV project. Please have a look at the license of the source code files if you plan to reuse them.
